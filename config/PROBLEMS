TARGETS WITH KNOWN PROBLEMS
===========================


hppa-hpux-cc
------------
The HP-UX C compiler generates incorrect code for the miniml
and petrol examples, when using the pushy runtime.


mips-ultrix-cc
--------------
The Ultrix C compiler dies when mf is compiled
with -no-Ocps: yacc stack overflow. Had to manually
move all locals to the top in mf/plain.b/test.c.
Perhaps the plain/switch/warped code generators should
do this automatically, rather than producing zillions
of nested scopes?

The C compiler does not implement 'const', and it does not use
ANSI-C semantics for char arrays initialized from string literals
(the terminating NUL is not included in the size).


rs6000-parix-*
--------------
Needs a faster run script.
/px/parix/bin/run zaps stdin! (XXX: Perhaps not any more??)


sparc-sos4-gcc
--------------
The SunOS 4 libc doesn't have "char *strerror(int errnum)", which
causes problems when building the miniml and petrol examples.


x86-*-gcc
---------
If you are using a version of gcc older than 2.8.0, then
please read the GCC.X86.PATCH file in this directory.


x86-sol2-*
----------
Used to work, but as I no longer have access to a machine
with Solaris x86, I cannot test this configuration.
