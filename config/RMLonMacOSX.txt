I got this one working on mac after a few small fixes. First of all, the 
bison shipped with os x 10.3 is too old, so I upgraded it (to 2.0). Then 
there was a problem with the termio. rml seems to use the old, 
non-posix, api which the mac doesn't support. This was fixed by creating 
a termio.h-file containing the following.

--8<--
#include <termios.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
--8<--

Once this was done everything compiles and it 
seems to work (I've been running the examples). 
The config entry is attached (see the ppc-darwin-gcc directory). 
I added the following to etc/config.guess

--8<--
  Darwin)
     OPSYS=darwin
     case `uname -m` in
       Power\ Macintosh) ARCH=ppc;;
       *) exit 1;;
     esac
     ;;
--8<--
